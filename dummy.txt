German New Guinea was a German colonial protectorate established in 1884 in the northeastern part of the island of 
New Guinea and several nearby island groups. The German New Guinea Company was founded in Berlin by Adolph von Hansemann 
and a syndicate of German bankers for the purpose of colonizing and exploiting the protectorate's resources. 
This gold coin, worth 20 New Guinean marks, was issued by the German New Guinea Company in 1895, 
and is now part of the National Numismatic Collection at the Smithsonian
